# TeamLumos

Welcome to team Lumos!

Our project is called New Struck(Tentative), based on the idea of combining food truck and digitalized social board, we hope to solve the problem of sharing, encouraging and expanding local news.

## Introduction
Our Project is called News Truck. News truck is born from the problem where we think that the medium or tools used to share local news has been overtaken by more engaging new tools, and no longer meet the needs of the public. People have always had the tools to disconnect themselves from their surroundings (magazines, books, walkmans), but now more than ever, commuters and pedestrians can deafen their senses and become completely unaware of their surroundings. This lacks the solidarity of noticing a stranger is reading the same paper as you, prompting an impromptu discussion. Reading the contents of someone else’s phone is considered extremely intrusive - there are no perceivable common interests between strangers consuming the news, and news no longer needs to be consumed publicly. We would like to bring back this unification by creating a unique and mobile space where people can consume and discuss news publically.

## Concept
As previously stated, our solution is to create a space where we could easily share, promote and endorse local news in populated local areas. We propose a cost-effective technological solution that presents news in an interesting and engaging way; a digitalized news or discussion board fixed to  the side of a large vehicle parked in a public place. Placing the screen on the side of a vehicle would not only allow the space to be set up in any public space with permitted parking, but also allow this space to be mobile, with the vehicle making intermittent stops to set up in numerous high-density areas. When the vehicle stops to set up, it can send out notifications to users either through a dedicated app or another form of mobile-oriented messaging, as well as setup a free public hotspot. The screen on the side of the truck is turned on, accompanying audio plays out of speakers fixed to the vehicle, and an array of different forms of news are displayed on the screen. The content could display anything from trending Twitter and Facebook content, the newest reviews for restaurants and venues, upcoming public events, QR codes for discounts and even public advertisements by nearby venues could display on-screen. Additionally, the truck could provide charging cables plugged into the truck for people looking to charge their mobile devices. Nearby pedestrians are drawn to the truck because of the visual and audio components, and can decide through ratings and polling which content is displayed on-screen, by either deciding what to show or even displaying their own messages.

### Project Aim

### Target Audience
The target audience of our solution is intended to be commuters, pedestrians, shoppers and any other such people who walk around public areas. As it is designed to attract people through sight and sound, it poses the risk of distracting drivers and consequently will always be set up to face away from roads, focusing entirely on pedestrians. The screens themselves should show simple infographics on trending social media topics, Youtube livestreams, live news reports and news recaps, as well as upcoming events in the local area, recent restaurant, venue reviews and favoured messages submitted by locals. Consequently, the target audience is quite wide and although not everyone can afford to have a mobile device, not being able to interact with the content shown is a light barrier. Anyone with sight or sound within the vicinity of the public space could be considered part of the target audience.

### Concept of Use
*


### Key differences to other available offerings 
The key difference between our solution and other platforms that deliver news is that other mediums like public news radio or televised displays are that these mediums do not allow the spectators to dictate what they see, and do not allow spectators to post their own content. Additionally, while shopping centre screens may convey events for that centre, they won’t necessarily describe upcoming events in the city that the centre resides in, or show live content. The static nature of public display screens means that while their content is often dynamic, it still requires updates, meaning they will never be completely up to date with world events.

All of the logistic responsibilities will be equally shared to all of the team member. Every person will be responsible for each transport required for transporting them to meeting location. All the equipment needed to develop the product will be the responsibility of each individual while resources needed to conduct experiment and deploying the product will be discussed together later on the development cycle.

### Decision Making

## Communication

## Plan

### Project Phases:

Research:

There are few aspects need to look in depth in order to facilitate social and promote local news such as:

(i) Interactive Touch Screen Board or Projector

One of the attractiveness of News Truck is presenting local news through a 
huge screen which allows multiple user to interact with it at once. However,
team needs to measure the feasibility and understand user’s preference to 
maximize the product usage. Survey or questionnaire regarding personal interest, frequent use of technologies and mechanism can be done to receive useful feedbacks from the local residence and retrieve possible insights to improve the overall product. 

(ii) Mobile or Web application

News Truck winden and expose local news of a section to another by travelling around. Therefore, a mobile application or web application will be created to assist users to interacts with the product such as leaving a comment for an article, sharing local news or event information and retrieving promotion gifts.

(iii) Incentives

Attractive incentives invite and encourage more participants to interact with the product as News Truck requires users to take initiatives to approach and connect from a limited range. At this stage, team had decided to include and provide local shop coupons and free access of Wi-Fi, more incentives will slowly be added in the future according to users preference.   
	
Requirements:

News Truck requires 2 digital interactive board or screen with size of 55’’ and above, 	a few screen mount will be needed to support and fix the screen position on the truck and keep it safe in position when travel from one destination to another. Hence, a few audio speakers will be placed around the truck to ensure the audio able to reach the audience from any direction within the range. 
	
Design:

News Truck design will be focus on supporting human-human interaction where users will be familiar with the product interface and able to utilise it with minimal learning curve and technology experience. Team will first determine the functional requirements and proceed to identify the user scenarios and try to understand the expectation of users for each scenarios. Process and information flow of the application will be added before implementing on specific physical platform. The interface of News Truck will mainly consist of a local news feeds board with users comment sections along with upvote and downvote system.   

	
Construction:

Each team members are assigned with different roles and the task will spread accordingly. News Truck will construct after the design is finalised along with the tech decision. However, due to the limited time frame and resources, prototype will be scaled down by replacing truck with RC truck and interactive screen with iPad. Frontend assignee will take care of the user registration on web or mobile application and design of News Truck interface. Meanwhile, backend assignee will handle application database usage and responds to frontend request and visual design assignee will maintain a healthy contrast within the application and provide pleasant aesthetic to the application. Usability testing will be done by testing the application with various of users and scenario while accessibility testing will be done using automated test tools. 

### Key Deliverables:
For each Interim sprint, we will discuss how the project has progressed and whether we’ve successfully accomplished our goals. In order to convey our progress, a small demonstration of our minimal viable product will be presented. As described by the table below, it details the key deliverables that should be presented at each of the interim sprints.

### Resources:
In order to deploy the prototype there are several components that must be acquired. These items can be broken down into 3 main groups; News truck, mobile development and news acquisition. The required items for each section is detailed below.

**News Truck:**
* Medium or Light Truck
* Capacitive 55” LCD touch screen or Rear Projection Screen with capacitive surface to allow interactivity. 
* Human Driver with truck license
* Cellular data (4G+) with Wi-fi router, enabling free Wifi within a certain range. The connection details are displayed on the truck surface. 
* Audio speakers, surround sound 5.1 

However, for the prototype we’ll require the following items:
* RC Truck
* iPad

**Mobile Development**
* Mobile or Web Developers and Designers
* Android Device & iOS to conduct quality assurance 
* Development Environment to design and program
* Web services to host Server API & Database to store information 

**News Acquisition** 
* News gathering algorithm to obtain articles, either via RSS feeds or directly from sites. Unlikely to be geo specific
* User generated content with GPS location. In addition, as the application is a free platform, locals can freely upload their news with ease. In order to integrate it into their current advertising structure, a guide would be provided.
