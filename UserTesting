User research is an important part of User Experience Design. Typically done at the start of a project, it encompasses different types of research methodology to gather both qualitative and quantitative data in relation to our product.

Quantitative data on the other hand is generally numerical data that can be measured and analysed, looking more at the statistics. Quantitative data is used to quantify the opinions and behaviors of targeted users. First Click Testing and A/B Testing are applied for this methodlogy.

Qualitative data is descriptive data and looks more at how people think and feel. It helps to find our target users opinions, problems, reasons and motivations. Interview method is applied for this methodology.

Each interview and testings aimed to draw out the flaws within the product. Each interview was
conducted with one interviewer and one target user of the product. Interviewee will be given a picture showing the general design and functionlities of NewsTruck follow by a few questions.
