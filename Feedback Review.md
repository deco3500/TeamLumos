# Feedback Review Summary Wk6:

From the feedback received in week 6. It can be summarised into the following two groups:

##Problems:
- Issue of distributing specific news that is easily digestible to our audience. If the truck is moving around periodically, news may not link up to one another in a relatable way
- If it is at one location for to long, incentives are required
- People already have phone, why an dedicated app when people can google themselves
- Check uniqueness
- Difficulty with implementation
- Potentially districting to drivers
- Define the purpose of truck more clearly
- How would we motivate people to interact with something new and different? 
- Filtering of inappropriate content. Requires filter

##Ideas:
- Projection screen onto buildings if possible
- Play music that indicate that the truck is here
- Top of screen, have larger text and at the bottom, smaller such that it is eye catching
- Locational information displayed
- Its novel

Looking at the feedback. The main concern appears to be incentive and how people would approach it. Thank you for the feedback and we'll take a look into solving these concerns.
