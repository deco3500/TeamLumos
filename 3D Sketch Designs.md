#3D Models and Design Decisions
After spending time on reasearching the logistical obstacles and necessary decisions of Newstruck, we decided that in order to ensure that the team shares the same vision, we needed to procure a 3D model. Regardless ofits detail or quality, having a 3D model allows the team to have a visual reference. While the initial intention was to use the model as a visual model, TinkerCad's online modelling software allows the designer to download and 3D print the model. This realization completely changed how we looked at displaying a prototype, since it allows us to display a smaller yet wholly realized first example.

As Figure 1 shows, with the green shade canvas and elevated compartment that resembles a counter, Newstruck resembles a food truck, which in turn gave us the idea to have goods be sold over the counter - potentially on the other end of the truck. The problem with this idea is that using the other side of the truck restricts us from parking the van on the side of the road, as pedestrians will need to stand on the street to order items over the counter. This will need to be re-considered, as we like the idea enough that we're committed to it, but perhaps one side will need a way to provide sufficient room for the electronics AND a counter with food.  
The orange side doors (which, when closed, protectect the screen and electronics from the outside), we realized that the side doors could operate as mobile bulletin boards, which provides another way for members of the public to leave public classified advertisments. Naturally this means that the side doors would need a cover of some kind to cover notices while the truck is moving, and this will be considered in further design updates.

The green canvas provides shade to reduce sun damage to the screen, as well as protect the electronics somewhat from rain. In the current sketch, the screen has neither wall arms or a protective case, and both of these will need to be considered in design, as right now there is no backing wall for the LCD screen to rest in. Whether it proves easier to suspend the screen from an arm attached to the ceiling, this will need to be decided soon. Additionally, USB port providers were quickly modelled and placed under the speakers - obviously they will need to be moved as users will not want to stand next to the speakers to charge their devices, but for now they are placed so we remember to include them in designs.

While the electronics, circuits, and vents may not be depicted in their entirety, we needed to consider the basic components such as solar panels, air vents, and the required space inside the van to have the whole system be safe yet operational. All of the components are depicted with their relative scale accurately, with the measurements of components from the logistics spreadsheet being followed closely. The model itself at the moment is scaled down (perhaps too far since the truck is 8 cm long!) to 1/50 of a properly sized prototype, so that 3D printing it is possible and inexpensive, and so that it can very easily be moved around during demonstrations. While it's an unrealistic pipedream, we are considering the possiblity of being able to fix the display to an RC car to simulate its mobile delivery behaviours.
